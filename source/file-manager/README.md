**Dynamix File Manager**

This plugin adds a simple file management functionality to the existing file browser function of the Unraid GUI.

Users can *Delete*, *Rename*, *Copy* and *Move* folders and files from the GUI. These actions can be applied to a single source or multiple sources at once.

Use with care! The file management feature is a powerful utility and gives the user full control over the Unraid file system.
