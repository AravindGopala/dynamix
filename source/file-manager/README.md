**Dynamix File Manager**

This is a plugin to add a simple file management functionality to the file browser feature of the Unraid GUI.
It is the intention to make this an integrated GUI feature in the future.

Users can *Delete*, *Rename*, *Copy* and *Move* folders and files from the GUI. These actions can be applied to a single source or multiple sources at once.

Use with care! The file management feature is a powerful utility and gives the user full control over his file system.
