**Dynamix Local Master**

Dynamix local master supports detection of the local master browser in an SMB network which uses NETBIOS for host discovery.

Networks using Web Services on Devices (WSD) do not have a local master browser and use broadcast messaging to do host discovery.

It will display <img src='/plugins/dynamix.local.master/icons/localmaster.png'> in the header at the top-left when Unraid is elected as local master browser.

Under SMB Workgroup settings more information about the current elected local master browser is given.
